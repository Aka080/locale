### Important

 - API response rate is extremely slow, so app becomes unresponsive most of the time.

### Thoughts what can be improved

  - Responsiveness of the design.
  - Give ability to filter out age on top of already queried data.
  - Maybe ability to see how numbers have changed after last scan.
